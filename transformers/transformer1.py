How do you cover nearly a century of sand, oil, and blood in less than four minutes? PIC Agencyâ€™s titles for The Kingdom do just that, 
giving viewers a geopolitical crash course in U.S.â€“Saudi Arabia relations that contextualizes the events depicted in the 2007 action thriller.
                  
Using a combination of infographics and news footage, this illustrated clash of cultures efficiently fills gaps missing in the viewerâ€™s knowledge of the region, 
its people, and its relationship with the West. A less inspired approach would have been to deliver the facts through a dry, text-only prologue; instead, 
the sequence envelops viewers in a sandstorm of charts and details. Before you can fully register one fact, youâ€™ve learned two more. Acting as a primer, 
a sort of CliffsNotes for Saudi Arabia, the sequence briefs us for entry into The Kingdom.
